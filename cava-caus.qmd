# Cavalier Causality (TODO) {#sec-cava-caus}

In @sec-incr-infe (Incredible Inferences), we began to see that we can be tricked by biases when we lack *causal* thinking and an underlying theory for the data generating process. In this chapter, we will revisit some of these same disasters and introduce some specific frameworks to help us more rigorously explore our analysis for errors and biases and, even better, strategize the best ways to fix them.
